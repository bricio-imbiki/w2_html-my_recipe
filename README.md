# LAB: My Recipe

**HTML - Week 2**

In this lab you will create a page for a recipe you love.  
By the end of the lab you should have an index.html that looks like this in the browser:  
<img src="assets/result.png" width="50%" height="" style="margin-x: auto">

‚ö†Ô∏è Please read the plan before starting the lab.

1. Fork the repository, and clone
2. Install Live Server extension in VS code
3. Do every exercice in their own branches
4. Merge all of your work in a newly created branch and publish

Good luck and have fun building your recipe page! üçΩÔ∏è

## 1. Fork this repository, clone, and open in VS code

To get started with the lab, you need to fork the repository:

1. Click on the **Fork** button at the top-right corner of the repository page.

3. Clone your new forked repository on your laptop
   2 ways possible to clone:
   - Clone with VS code (without line command):

   - Clone using the git clone command:

## 2. New Tool: Live Server + VS Code

For this lab, we will use the **Live Server** extension in VS Code to preview our HTML changes in real time.

### What is Live Server?

Live Server is a **VS Code extension** that allows you to launch a local development server with **auto-refresh** whenever you save changes to your HTML file.

### How to Install & Use Live Server

1. Open **VS Code**.
2. Go to **Extensions** (Ctrl+Shift+X or Cmd+Shift+X on Mac).
3. Search for **Live Server** and install it.
4. Open your **HTML file** in VS Code.
5. Right-click and select **"Open with Live Server"**, OR click on the **"Go Live"** button in the status bar.
6. Your browser will open with the live preview of your file.

## 3. Exercices

Now we can start the lab.  
The page you will create is divided into 5 parts:  
<img src="assets/sections.png" width="50%" height="" style="margin-x: auto">

**For every exercise/section you will**  
**- checkout the associated branch**  
**- read the intrcutions to build the section in the readme.md**  
**- edit the index.html file and commit**  

**Below are the names of the branches for every section:**  
**[ex1](https://github.com/onja-org/W2_html-my-recipe/tree/header-setup/ex1-instructions#readme): `header-setup`**  
**[ex2](https://github.com/onja-org/W2_html-my-recipe/tree/ingredients/ex2-instructions#readme): `ingredients`**  
**[ex3](https://github.com/onja-org/W2_html-my-recipe/tree/steps/ex3-instructions#readme): `steps`**  
**[ex4](https://github.com/onja-org/W2_html-my-recipe/tree/links/ex4-instructions#readme): `links`**  
**[ex5](https://github.com/onja-org/W2_html-my-recipe/tree/paragraph/ex5-instructions#readme): `paragraph`**  

**Now, until you finish the exerice/section 5, you can leave this readme.md instruction.**  
‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è**Once you've finished the section 5, remember to return to this readme.md (main branch) to continue the lab**


## 4. Merge and publish

Once you finished all exercises, merge all your work into a new branch named `total-merge`:

1. create the `total-merge` branch from the `main` branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git checkout -b total-merge
   git checkout total-merge
   ```

2. Merge header-setup
   ```bash
   git merge header-setup
   ```
   then you'll see a message in the terminal:  
   <img src="assets/merge-ok-msg.png" width="50%" height="" style="margin-x: auto">  
   This is showing the message for the future commit of the merge.  
   `Merge branch 'header-setup' into total-merge` is the message. The rest are commentaries.  
   You can either keep the message or edit it.  
   Whe you are ready to commit the merge, just type: `:qa` and then press <kbd>Return</kbd>
   
   Easy ! right :) ? Let's continue  

3. Merge ingredients:
   ```bash
   git merge ingredients
   ```
   Oups, there's a merge conflict...
   # ‚ö†Ô∏è to complete
   You know why ? Because ...

   **Let's fix this conflict üõ†Ô∏è**  
   When you open your index.html, you'll see you have a combinason of header-setup and ingredients with two lines:
   - ``
   - ``
   - sfvg
   <img src="assets/merge-conflict-editor.png" width="50%" height="" style="margin-x: auto">  

   These 3 lines are here to show you the 2 versions of the file that git doesn't know how to combine. Therefore you have to decide the final combinason.
   You can remove the 3 lines, save the file, and look at the result in the live server.
   Edit your file until you are satisfied with the result.
   When you are satified, just commit:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit 
   ```
   <img src="assets/merge-conflict-commit-msg.png" width="50%" height="" style="margin-x: auto">  
   This is showing the message for the future commit of the merge.  
   `Merge branch 'ingredients' into total-merge` is the message. The rest are commentaries.  
   You can either keep the message or edit it.  
   Whe you are ready to commit the merge, just type: `:qa` and then press <kbd>Return</kbd>

4. Continue by yourself:
   - You can refer to `3. Merge ingredients` to help you merge the rest of your work into total-merge.
     Merge the branches **following this order**:
        - header-setup (done)
        - ingredients (done)
        - steps
        - links
        - paragraph
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è be careful when mergin paragraph: you'll need to make sure it is positionned under the image, just like in the picture of the expected final result.
   
ü•≥ Yeaaaaah !!!! You've reached the end of the lab :)
